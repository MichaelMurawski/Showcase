# Showcase
Showcase for code and solved assignments


You can find the majority of my code or excel models here. I exclusively use Excel, VBA and R.
The upload format is usually a source file or a comprehensive PDF File.

Since I am a self-starter and I don't have a computer science background, the code works, but is usually not the most efficient 

I am currently using my "Covid free time" to build a typical integrated 3-statement model with a dashboard based on youtube tutorials and the "Gridlines Essential Financial Modelling" Course.


Further uploads will cover:

Have fun with the code

Kindest regards,
