You can find the majority of my code here. I primarily use R,Python and VBA.
The upload format is usually a source file or a comprehensive PDF File.

Since I am a self-starter and I don't have a computer science background, the code works, but is usually not the most efficient 

Within the next 3 months, I will also add extensive explanations for the code.
The same also applies for translation of old assignments and code German language into English.

Topics my code will cover:                                                                                                                                                  
#Operational tools                                                                                                                          
#Spreadsheets and Code for private investing (Portfolio analysis)                                                                                                                                                              
#Dataset Analysis (Time-series, Cross Sectional,Panel)

Have fun with the code
