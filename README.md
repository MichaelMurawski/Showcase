# Showcase
Showcase for code and solved assignments

You can find the majority of my code here. I primarily use R,Python and VBA.
The upload format is usually a source file or a comprehensive PDF File.

Since I am a self-starter and I don't have a computer science background, the code works, but is usually not very efficient and the formal code quality is not flawless.

When I find the time, I will also add extensive explanations for the code.
The same also applies for translation of old assignments and code in German language.

Topics my code covers or will cover
Operational tools (VBA)
Spreadsheets and Code for private investing (Portfolio analysis)
Dataset Analysis (Time-series, Cross Sectional,Panel)
Data Visualization 
Machine Learning/AI Models

Have fun with the code
