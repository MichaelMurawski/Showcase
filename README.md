You can find the majority of my code here. I primarily use R,Python and VBA.
The upload format is usually a source file or a comprehensive PDF File.

Since I am a self-starter and I don't have a computer science background, the code works, but is usually not very efficient and the formal code quality is not flawless.

When I find the time, I will also add extensive explanations for the code.
The same also applies for translation of old assignments and code in German language.

Topics my code will cover:
#Operational tools
#Spreadsheets and Code for private investing (Portfolio analysis)
#Dataset Analysis (Time-series, Cross Sectional,Panel)
#Data Visualization 
#Machine Learning/AI Models

Have fun with the code
